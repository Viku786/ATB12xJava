        :-  Learn how protected members behave in inheritance.
        üìù Instructions:
            Create a class Animal with a protected method eat()
            that prints "Animal is eating".
            Create a child class Dog that extends Animal.
            Create a method doEat() in Dog class which calls eat() using inheritance.
            In main(), create a Dog object and call doEat().
